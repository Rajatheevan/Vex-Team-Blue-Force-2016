# Blue Force!!! 

Welcome Programming Team, 

  This repository will be the basis for all of our work on project 'Pan'.
  
  Additionally this readme will cover all of the concepts for our design and as such operates as a design document. The format is log based and any changes must be dicated with an entry into the changelog with the date and time [see date log].
  
  Our program of choice this session is Robot C. Make sure to read up on the [rules](http://cdn.robotc.net/pdfs/nxt/curriculum/Fundamentals%20-%20ROBOTC%20programming%20for%20LEGO.pdf) and the general help [documents](http://help.robotc.net/WebHelpVEX/index.htm)
